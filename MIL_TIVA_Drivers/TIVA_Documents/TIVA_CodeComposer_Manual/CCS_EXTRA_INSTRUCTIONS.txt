Desc: Additional procedures for making
      projects in code composer using 
      TivaWare

What is TivaWare: If you've taken uP
	you know the pain of writing register level code.
	TivaWare is a HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) provided
	by TI which includes a set of functions to allow you
	to fully configure and interact with the MCU platform 
	without ever having to go down to the register level which
	speeds up development significantly.


DO FIRST: follow TI instructions in the 
	  spmu352 pdf on installing
          CCS and TivaWare

INSTRUCTIONS:
Basically everytime you set up a new project, just copy and 
paste a project that's already set up to use TivaWare. When 
you first follow the instructions for installation, you'll have a bunch of example
projects to look at. Literally right click an opened project,copy it,
and paste it in your IDE. 

The reason for this is that each project has to be configured and linked
to the libray files. It's easier to copy and paste then sit down and
configure it yourself.
